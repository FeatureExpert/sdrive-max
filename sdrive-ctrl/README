sdrive.atr has a special boot code for autoloading and a simple boot menu
(by holding shift key), where the start sectors of the files are hardcoded,
so the filesystem structure must not be modified!

Files may be updated, but not deleted and created again!

I use the emulator "atari800 sdrive.atr sdrive-noboot.atr"
and copy the files each over from D2: to D1:.
