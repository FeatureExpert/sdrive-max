SDrive-MAX
==========

SDrive-MAX is a new disk drive emulator for Atari 8bit computers based on
sdrive-ng ported to arduino and enhanced with a touchscreen display for
controlling. So it can work without sdrive software on the Atari, but could
be used anyway. Changing disk images during live operation is one of the
most important features, i think.

What do you need?

- an arduino UNO with atmega328p
- an Elegoo 2,8" TFT-Touchscreen Shield or similar with ILI9341 compatible
  controller using 8bit parallel mode(i think, that one from the adafruit
  project is the same). Touchlines must be wired as followed:

  X+ <-> 8
  X- <-> A2
  Y+ <-> A3
  Y- <-> 9

  The other lines are always the same, as far as i could see
  (TFT-Data 2-9, -Ctrl. A0-A4, SD 10-13). In doubt, ask!
- a diode 1N4148 or similar
- a micro SD-Card(SD or SDHC)
- some cable and connectors to Atari's SIO-Port
- avrdude Software for firmware programming

Wirering Arduino <-> Atari-SIO:

  TXD <-> Pin 3 (Data-In, over the diode, cathode to arduino)
  GND <-> Pin 4	(Ground)
  RXD <-> Pin 5 (Data-Out)
  A5  <-> Pin 7 (Command)
* +5V <-> Pin 10 (+5V/Ready)

*Optional, if you want power from Atari, but then you can't use Display
 while Atari ist powered off!

Firmware programming:

First use the eeprom-writer.hex to set the correct values to the EEPROM!
Then programm the SDrive.hex into the flash.
That's it!

Display usage:

- press drive buttons in the middle to select the actual boot drive (D1:)
  (on startup always the internal drive D0: with SDRIVE.ATR loaded is selected
  for old sdrive(-ng) compatibility)
- press drive buttons on the left do deactivate the drive
- press dirve buttons on the right at the disk logo to insert an image
- D0: can only be selected as boot drive, not changed
- press on the New button will create a new image on the selected drive
  during the next format command
- press on the output window at bottom will open SIO debug mode. To close
  press anywhere on the screen
- file select window should be self descripting
